        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This typical Brazilian snack is lightly crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, and has a cheese flavor that just hugs your mouth.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 10oz round of Queso Fresco, crumbled</li>
            <li>1 cup full fat milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil for oiling your hands</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 lb tapioca flour also known as tapioca starch</li>
            <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>Add the tapioca flour and the salt to a large bowl, whisk to combine and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the cheeses and the eggs and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the milk and the oil to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer on stove top over medium heat</li>
            <li>When the liquid simmers, remove the pan from heat, and immediately pour the hot liquid into the tapioca mixture and using a wooden spoon, stir to combine – the mixture will not be homogeneous, it'll be gummy and clumpy. See step by step images above for reference.</li>
            <li>Wait 5-10 minutes until the tapioca mixture is cool to touch, and only then add the cheese and egg mixture to the tapioca mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon, or your hands to combine. Now you should have a homogeneous mixture and it should come together as a ball. You'll still see some white tapioca specks in the dough – don't worry, that's totally normal!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Roll the balls</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Oil your hands, then scoop a Tbsp to 2Tbsp size portions, roll them into balls, and arrange them in a baking sheet approximately 2" apart from one another.</li>
            <li>Bake until golden brown, approximately 30-35 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
